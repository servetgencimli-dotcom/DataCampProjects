There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\nschools\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Select relevant columns and sort by 'average_math' in descending order\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\nbest_math_schools\n\n# Fix: Use the correct column name 'school_name' instead of 'schools_name'\ntop_10_schools = schools[\"school_name\"]\n\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools\n\nschools\n\n# FIXED CODE BELOW\n# 1.
